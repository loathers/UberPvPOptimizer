Original script here, with history:
https://kolmafia.us/threads/fork%C2%B2-uberpvpoptimizer-an-updated-pvpbestgear.18356/

This script will help you optimize your gear for the PVP mini-games. There are options to buy cheap(configurable, default 1k) mall gear that is better than what you have, and give a comprehensive list of the best gear in-game with wiki links to research how to acquire it. 
 
Configuration for the script can be seen typing `zlib pvp` in the GCLI.
